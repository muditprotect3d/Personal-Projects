# Personal-Projects

My name is Mudit Agrawal and I am a current student at Duke University studying Mechanical Engineering, Energy and the Environment and I&E.
This repository includes some of my personal projects that I have worked on so far! 

# Energy Model
This is a model of an Electric Water Heater that I created that shows two outputs -- temperature over time as a result of desired flow rate, and power required to provide this flow rate to the user. There are a couple of assumptions that I have taken into account with this model that help with the simplification without a detriment to the accuracy as a whole

# Clustering Algorithm using K_Means

This is a project I worked on over the summer that takes an input of arrays and points and creates a clustering graph based off of user inputted locations and shapes
